## Description

### Abundance

Larvae were classified in `r length(unique(na.omit(d$family)))` families, `r length(unique(na.omit(d$genus)))` genera and `r length(unique(na.omit(d$species)))` identifiable species. 

CPUE is presented (still on a log10 scale, beware!) for the most abundant families, genera, and species below (ordered from most abundant to least abundant). Each dot represents the CPUE for one night in one site. The "violin"-shape represents the distribution of observations: the CPUE levels most commonly observed correspond to the wider regions of the shape.

```{r plots, warning=FALSE}

# families
dd <- d0 %>%
  filter(!is.na(family)) %>%
  group_by(date, site, family) %>%

  summarise(mean=mean(cpue), median=median(cpue)) %>%
  ungroup() %>% arrange(desc(mean)) %>% head(12)
# TODO check if there are some other interesting families beyond these 12
abundant_families <- dd_stat$family
dd$family <- factor(dd$family, levels=dd_stat$family)
ggplot(na.omit(dd), aes(x=family, y=cpue)) + geom_violin(na.rm=T) + geom_point(alpha=0.2, size=1) + scale_y_continuous(trans="log10") + theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=25, hjust=1))

# genera
dd <- d0 %>%
  filter(!is.na(genus)) %>%

  group_by(family, genus) %>%

# TODO same as for families
abundant_genera <- dd_stat$genus
dd$genus <- factor(dd$genus, levels=dd_stat$genus)

# add the list of common taxa to what was already in "data.rda"
save(abundant_families, abundant_genera, abundant_species, list=load("data.rda"), file="data.rda")
```

At the level of a any given taxon, the catch is most often < 1 fish/CARE/night/site and very variable. Despite the extreme variability, the most abundant taxa in CARE catches are not surprising given what we know of the coastal adult populations.


### Distribution

There are `r nrow(sites)`. Here we sort families, genera and species according to the number of sites they are caught in, stopping at 7 sites (about half the total):

```{r freq_sp}
common <- function(d, level) {
  d %>%
    filter_(str_c("!is.na(",level,")")) %>%
    group_by_(level) %>%
    summarise(n_sites=length(unique(site))) %>%
    arrange(desc(n_sites)) %>%
    filter(n_sites > 7)
}

common_families <- common(d, "family")
common_genera <- common(d, "genus")
common_species <- common(d, "species")

# display them
common_families
common_genera
common_species
```

These most frequent species are mostly the same as the most abundant ones, except for *Oblada melanura* and *Boops boops* which are abundant but present in only 3 sites.

## Comparison with adult assemblages

As written above, larvae were classified in `r length(unique(na.omit(d$family)))` families, `r length(unique(na.omit(d$genus)))` genera and `r length(unique(na.omit(d$species)))` identifiable species.

```{r read_adults, results="hide"}
# read species list of north west mediterranean
library("readxl")
l <- read_excel("data/Liste especes mediterranee.xlsx", sheet=1)

# clean names written in the file
l$family <- str_trim(str_to_lower(l$family))
l$genus <- str_trim(str_to_lower(l$genus))
l$species <- str_trim(str_to_lower(l$species))

# remove undetermined species (1 atherinidae sp.)
l <- filter(l, species != "sp.")

# check that each genus has the same family
filter(summarise(group_by(l, genus), n=length(unique(family))), n>1)

# remove non-demersal fish
non_demersal <- c(
"engraulidae",   # anchois
"scombridae",    # thons...
"clupeidae",     # sardines
"sphyraenidae",  # barracudas
"exocoetidae",   # poissons volants
"coryphaenidae", # coryphÃ¨ne
"chlorophthalmidae",
"xiphiidae",     # espadons
"istiophoridae", # marlin
"trichiuridae",  # sabres
"molidae",       # poisson lune
"regalecidae",   # regalec
"trachipteridae",
"ammodytidae",   # profond  # ??? TODO check
"macrouridae",   # profond

"petromyzonidae" # eggs in river 
)

l$demersal <- ! l$family %in% non_demersal
l_demersal <- filter(l, demersal == TRUE)

l$family <- str_to_title(l$family)
l$genus <- str_to_title(l$genus)

l_demersal$family <- str_to_title(l_demersal$family)
l_demersal$genus <- str_to_title(l_demersal$genus)

# Join genus and species suffix in species column
l_demersal$species <- str_c(l_demersal$genus, " ", l_demersal$species)
```

According to Louisy:

- Teleost species of North Western Mediterranean are classified in `r length(unique(l$family))` families, `r length(unique(l$genus))` genera, and `r length(unique(l$species))` species. 

- Among which, dermersal species represent `r length(unique(l_demersal$family))` families, `r length(unique(l_demersal$genus))` genera, and `r length(unique(l_demersal$species))` species.

Comparing the list in Louisy and the list from CARE catches, the following families of demersal fish were never caught:

`r (uncaught_families <- sort(setdiff(l_demersal$family, d$family)))`.

Among families which are caught, the following genera were never caught either:

```{r}
filter(l_demersal, ! family %in% uncaught_families &! genus %in% unique(d$genus)) %>% select(family, genus) %>% unique() %>% arrange(family, genus)
```

To summarise :

- `r round((length(unique(na.omit(d$family)))*100)/length(unique(l$family)), 0)`% of families, `r round((length(unique(na.omit(d$genus)))*100)/length(unique(l$genus)), 0)`% of genera, and `r round((length(unique(na.omit(d$species)))*100)/length(unique(l$species)), 0)`% of species recorded in Louisy were catched in CAREs. 

- `r round((length(unique(na.omit(d$family)))*100)/length(unique(l_demersal$family)), 0)`% of families , `r round((length(unique(na.omit(d$genus)))*100)/length(unique(l_demersal$genus)), 0)`% of genera, and `r round((length(unique(na.omit(d$species)))*100)/length(unique(l_demersal$species)), 0)`% of species recorded as demersal fish were catched in CAREs.
